# SPAAM3 Code of conduct

All attendees and members of SPAAM are obliged to follow the [Code of conduct of the SPAAM community](/code-of-conduct.html)

## TL;DR

* All attendees and members of SPAAM are expected to be respectful towards all members regardless of background, and actively participate in creating a welcoming and friendly community. 
* Unacceptable or illegal behaviour will not be tolerated and the organisers reserve the right to remove anyone violating the Code of Conduct from both in-person or online channels.
* If at any point you feel unsafe or the code of conduct is violated, please contact any of the following [SPAAM3 organising committee](#1-contact-info) who will deal with any issues respectfully and anonymously, as required.

> This is only for guidance, and [Code of conduct of the SPAAM community](/events/spaam3/code_of_conduct.html) is the enforceable document.
