We are a community of researchers focusing on ancient metagenomics.

We aim to regularly meet to share knowledge on solutions to common challenges
and obstacles that the field faces, with cycling organising committees. We also
collectively run projects for the benefit of the whole community.

We also have a [slack
channel](https://join.slack.com/t/spaam-community/shared_invite/zt-ei8pfw4m-XdBGTQwRaXWrEkd618YlhQ)
for day-to-day advice, help, brainstorming, news, networking, and socialising. You can also join our [mailing list](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/info/spaam-community) and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/spaam_community).
